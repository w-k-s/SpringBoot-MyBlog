A project to try out various Spring Technologies.

Requirements

- [x] A boot JAR using spring boot.
- [x] Rest endpoints that can return a `JSON` response.
- [x] Endpoint that returns an HTML page with a model from java using `thymeleaf`
- [x] Models should be picked up from DB using `JPA` we will use `Hibernate`.
- [ ] *must* have `unit-test` and `mockMVC` tests.
- [x] For the models you should use an `SQL` db recommended `MySql`
- [x] The endpoints should be secured with basic auth and the user data should be on a in memory db like `H2` (edited)

Nice to Have:

- [ ] Make the db boot in a docker container.
- [x] Configure the db url with a YAML
